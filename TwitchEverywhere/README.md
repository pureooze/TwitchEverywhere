# TwitchEverywhere

`TwitchEverywhere` is a .NET Core library that allows connecting to a Twitch chat and subscribing to messages in that chat.

Twitch requires an authenticated connection to the IRC server which can get a bit complicated to setup and maintain. Fortunately `TwitchEverywhere` can do that for you! ðŸ˜€
